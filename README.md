# redi-python-intermediate

Welcome to my Python Intermediate final project. This is a text-based version of the popular card game, Cards Against Humanity.
Cards Against Humanity allows the open use of their cards, as long as you don't make money off of it. For more information, visit their website at https://www.cardsagainsthumanity.com/#downloads

In this project, there is usage of the following:
- Object-oriented Programming
- Requests, Modules
- Error Handling

To play this game, it is best to run the game.py file from a command line to make use of screen clearing from the operating system (running from an IDE like PyCharm will not show the screen clearing); although there is code for screen clearing for macOS/linux, it is untested and unconfirmed to work.

At the beginning of the game, there is an option to play with only the Family Edition (kid-friendly version). You must have at least 4 players to play. At each player's turn, their hand is not revealed until the player presses the Enter key; this is the opportunity for others to step away from the screen to give the player their privacy when they choose which card to submit.

Have fun!
